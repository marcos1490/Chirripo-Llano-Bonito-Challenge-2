Chirripo Llano Bonito Challenge 2 - Mobile Route Analyzer
=================================
Create a mobile app that will help analyze routes. 

This is explained with an example: let’s say you want to analyze your route to the office and back home every day (how long does it take in average to arrive to the office or back home, where is the bottleneck in your route, where are you wasting most of your time in transit, etc). 
The app should allow you to hit “START” and that will make the app to start collecting GPS points and store them in the mobile device; then when you arrive to your destination you’ll need to press a “STOP” button, telling the app to stop collection GPS points.  The app will then collect a start and an end point and multiple waypoints along the route. You should be able to configure multiple routes and select which one you are going to use (e.g. “To the office”, “Back home”, “To the office passing downtown”, etc.). 

Then there will be an analyze screen where the app will show statistics collected from multiple runs on the selected route, this screen will show a map where the route is drawn and also will show the following statistics: 
- Average transit time (the average time it takes to go from start to end)
- Quickest run (show time it took to go from start to end and the date/time it happened)
- Slowest run (time it took, and date/time it happened). 

In summary the app will have three screens: configure routes, run route, analyze routes. 

Also, as optional an bonus screen, you can present a bar chart where you draw each day duration (X-axis show days in month and/or week and Y-axis shows time).
